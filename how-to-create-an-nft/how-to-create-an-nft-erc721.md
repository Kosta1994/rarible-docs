For this example, we'll be using a PNG Image. Next, we'll setup an instant sale price, this will immediately sell the item if the user is willing to pay the price you set. Even with an instant sale price, you will still be able to receive bids on your item. In this case, our instant sale price is 1 Ether \(At the time of writing, the value of 1 Ether is roughly $603.50\).

\(Optional\) If you want to add a link to the Hi-resolution version of your artwork you can do so by adding an unlockable to the creation process.

Next, we're going to setup the important part of our NFT and that is the NFT Details, 

* Choose Collection: you can create your own or use the default collection which is Rarible, you can think of collections as a folder, you can either create your own folder or use the public folder which in this case is Rarible.
* Name: This is the name of your NFT
* Description: This is the description of your NFT
* Royalties: This is set as a percentage, which you the creator will receive whenever your NFT is sold on the secondary market.
* Properties: You can think of the Properties section as Metadata for your NFT, Key is the title and value is the description, and example would be Key: Artist Name, Value: Rarible.com
