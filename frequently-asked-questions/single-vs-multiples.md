# Single VS Multiple

### Single

A single NFT uses the ERC721 NFT standard. ERC721 cannot be used to create multiple copies of a single token.

### Multiple

A multiple NFT uses the ERC1155 Token Standard, this standard can be used to create multiple instances of a single token, you can think of this as making Multiple copies of an image, they will all be identical.
